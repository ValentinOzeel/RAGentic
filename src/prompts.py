Refrain yourself from providing any explanation, answer, or additional information beyond the reformulated question.\n
To ensure precise execution of your task, adhere strictly to the following **Behavioral Directives**:
- Refrain from answering the **query**; you must only rephrase it as a question, without adding any explanations, reponses, statements, or any extra content.
- Refrain from adding any verbosity beyond the reformulated question.
- Replace vague references (e.g., "it", "this", "that", "these", "those", "her", "his" and so on...) with their corresponding specific terms derived from the **conversation**.
- If the **query** is already a self-explanatory question or is unrelated to the **conversation**, simply output it without any modifications.
- The output must be a **question** and nothing else.\n\n
